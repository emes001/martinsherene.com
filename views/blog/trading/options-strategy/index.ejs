		<strong><em>PUTting Market Trends</em></strong> is an options strategy
		that deals with the buying and selling of <strong>PUT</strong> contracts
		related to sudden downtrends/reversals in the stock market.
	</p>
	<p>
		This particular strategy requires patience and paying attention to the
		"big picture." By "big picture" I mean the overall stock market,
		particularly the <span data-term="SPY">S&amp;P 500 (SPY)</span> and
		<span data-term="QQQ">NASDAQ (QQQ)</span>. How are they doing? Are they
		uptrending? Downtrending? Or are they just flat?
	</p>
	<p>
		If you didn't already know, mid- and large-cap companies tend to follow
		market trends. If the market is doing well, so will the company. If the
		market is downtrending, so will the company. I should note that this
		rule applies when there is not other significant recent and/or upcoming
		news/events that may affect the company. <strong>Also - penny stocks do
		not apply as they have a mind of their own.</strong>

		alt="8/16/2017 5-minute charts of QQQ and SPY" title="Click to enlarge"  class="chart-right" />
		Take a look at the following QQQ and SPY charts
		from August 16, 2017. You'll notice two things: 1) their overall patterns
		very closely mimic one another<sup>1</sup>, and 2) after a slight dip at market open, both began
		uptrending as per the norm (with slight pullbacks throughout) between
		10am and 12:30pm Eastern.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/images/blog/trading/options-strategy/aapl-20170816-5min-chart.png" width="277" height="133"
		alt="8/16/2017 5-minute chart of AAPL" title="Click to enlarge"  class="chart-right" />
		Now take a look at Apple's (AAPL) chart from the same day. Notice the
		reversal that occurred at 12:30pm, right in line with the market (I've
		included thumbnail charts of QQQ and SPY in the upper-right corner for
		reference). There was no damming news that prompted this reversal for
		Apple, it was just following the market. Why is that? You can thank
		institutional (hedge funds, banks, etc.) and retail (average Joe Schmoe)
		investors alike - neither like when the overall market is dipping, and
		will begin to sell off parts of their positions to preserve capital.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that we've established a correlation between price action for AAPL
		<sup>2</sup>, SPY and QQQ, let's figure out how we can use that knowledge
		as a means for profiting from the stock market. On one hand, if you
		noticed a sharp dip (and what could be the beginning of a reversal) in
		SPY or QQQ, you could decide to short sell AAPL, expecting it to follow
		the current market trend. If you were to have shorted 100 shares of AAPL
		at 12:30 for an average price of 162.25 and then cover around 2pm at
		160.75, you would've profited $150 (100 shares * $1.50 difference).
		However, <strong>that would've required buying power of over
		$16000!</strong> Chances are if you're reading this, you're trying to
		grow a small account and your buying power may not be that large.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/images/blog/trading/options-strategy/aapl-20170818-162.5-put.png" width="274" height="129"
		alt="8/16/2017 5-minute chart of an AAPL put contract" title="Click to enlarge"  class="chart-right" />
		This is where the beauty of options comes in. Take a look at the chart
		to the right, displaying the price of an AAPL put contract (strike of
		$162.50, expiration 8/18/17). At 12:30pm, the beginning of the reversal,
		this particular contract was going for about a dollar premium (so
		$100/contract, as a contract is 100 (shares) * premium ($)). Even at
		1pm, the contract was still going for around $1.25/e. By 2:30pm, these
		same contracts were selling for upwards of $2.50 each! If you would've
		bought these contracts at 1pm, and sold 90 minutes later, you would've
		doubled your money (or more, if you got in earlier)! <strong>This type
		of risk/reward (particularly for the amount of capital required) for
		AAPL is only possible with options.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now you're probably wondering, <em>why did I choose that particular
		contract?</em> Here is my reasoning:
		<ul>
			<li>I chose a PUT contract over a CALL, because I wanted to follow
			the trend. You can try to predict where the market may bounce/recover
			based on support/resistance lines, however if those fail, a CALL
			contract may end up being worthless.</li>
			<li>I chose the closest expiration because there's no telling
			what the market will do tomorrow, the remainder of the week, <thead>
			following week, etc. I was interested in capturing the market's
			volatility for that day.</li>
			<li>I also close the closest expiration because then I don't have
			to pay a higher premium for the contract due to time (extrinsic)
			value.</li>
			<li>I chose the $162.50 strike because it was the closest
			at-the-money/in-the-money contract, and I did not want to pay a
			higher premium for additional intrinsic value.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now for the best part: <strong>many companies that follow market trends
		lag behind the market.</strong> What does this mean? That means if the
		market downtrends at 1pm, there will be 1 or more companies that will
		begin mimicing that same trend 5, 10, even up to an <strong>HOUR</strong>
		later. This gives you the peace of mind of confirming the market is
		in a downtrend, and then placing your order(s) for PUT contracts.
	</p>
	<p>
		So what companies should you watch out for? Well, I'm not going to spoon
		feed you. That's for you to figure out. Look up various indexes and ETFs,
		and figure out which companies they represent. Then look at charts... lots
		and lots of charts, comparing the company's history to the market.
	</p>
	<p>
		Last but not least, this strategy should be applied to companies that:
		<ul>
			<li>Follow market trends</li>
			<li>Are optionable</li>
			<li><strong>Have a healthy amount of [options] volume</strong></li>
		</ul>
	</p>

			<li>QQQ and SPY usually follow one another, and can be used as an
			indicator for the other. If one starts to go up/down, the other will
			likely follow within a few seconds. Generally, mid- and large- caps
			will follow suit soon after.</li>
			<li>Apple is one of many companies that follow market trends. To
			find other potential candidates, look up which companies belong
			to various indexes (S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, etc.) and ETFs.
			Then from that list, choose a few individual companies and compare
			their chart history with that of QQQ and SPY.</li>
